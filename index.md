# Welcome to my site!

## From 2025-12-23
I was planning on remigrating my site back onto here, but honestly, I really enjoy
using markdown.

I think moving forward, this will be my chosen method of updating y'all on things,
from blogposts-- to documentation. 

I really don't like creating websites from scratch, which is why my previous site used [framer](https://framer.com).
It was an easy to use tool, however it is MAAAAAAAAAD unaffordable. So we ended up using github pages as someone
recommended to me on LinkedIN.

# What do I plan to do with this page?

I'm unsure-- more than likely going to use it as a portfolio page like my last website.
I might test some things out here-- like `webasm` and some other things. For now though,
the page will just hold this `index.md` file until I can get used to this new format style.
