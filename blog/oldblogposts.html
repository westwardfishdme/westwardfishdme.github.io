  <h1>The state of ye old blog</h1>
  <p>
    Short answer, I'm too lazy to reupload the full blog.
    Long answer: if you want to visit the old site to read
    my old blogposts, you can go <a target="_parent" href="https://willing-english-281422.framer.app/blog">here.</a>
    <br><br>
    I don't really care about reuploading any of the content-- as it's still freely accessible,
    but as of this point forward, I am going to be uploading all future blogposts here.
