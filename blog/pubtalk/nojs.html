  <h1>I hate JavaScript</h1>
  <h3>Date: 2026-01-28 </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      I personally, hate Javascript. I hate coding in Javascript, I hate
      the syntax of Javascript, I hate everything about the language.
      <br><br>
      You see the whole reason why I chose to use a framework in the
      first place was because I personally will NEVER write Javascript/TypeScript
      willingly, unless I have an absolute need to for a project.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>
      Good question.
      <br><br>
      First and foremost, the language itself is inferior to it's *successor Typescript, but
      what's even better is WASM (blog post is done, you can click off now).

      But even then I won't ever write TypeScript either because it ALSO shares
      the same grievances I have with Javascript and nonetheless, will never be
      willingly be written by me. This is because the language's logic is so
      damn stupid.
    </p>
    <div>
      <pre>
        <code class="js">
console.log(NaN===NaN) // =false (wtf?)
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p id="quote">Don't get me wrong, this is the same in other languages (Rust comes to mind) but at the minimum-- I have a type system where this
      gets limited to for numerics. I.e. 'NaN==NaN = false' will always only occur for floating point integers</p>
    </div>
      <p>
      Secondly, I don't have time to learn about front-end design. In my heart,
      I am a systems level architect and engineer. I care about the level <b>below</b>
      the browser. I have spent so much more time developing and writing code that makes
      most sense at the systems level because at the end of the day, the systems matter
      more than the presentation.
      <br><br>
      <b>The manipulation of data is the only meaningful part of anything computationally wise, the rest of it is
        time best spent optimizing and organizing.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly, I don't necessarily need to specialize myself in front-end design, there are other people
      out there who enjoy it-- just like how there are people who enjoy masochism.
      <br><br>
      Personally, it's not my cup of tea-- but hey, if you like it, cool. I'm not gonna sit here and
      tell you that "you shouldn't put your d*ck in hot candle wax" if it makes you happy. It's not my place
      (and never will be) to tell you that you "should" or "shouldn't" do something. If you like that sort of stuff
      go ahead, that's just freedom baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all seriousness, that's also the beauty in economies of scale-- everyone is allowed to do what they
      enjoy in a workplace environment (not masochism hopefully...) and they can contribute to the greater value of a
      project in whatever way they specialized themselves in.
    </p>
    <p></p>
  </div>
  <h2>Just because I said I hate front-end work, doesn't mean I won't implement functionality.</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Now don't get my words all twisted up-- if the need/desire arises, I will write some
      code to do do whatever it is that I need to do for this site, but I can guarantee you that it will be
      written in Rust/WASM, and not JS/TS. Even though this site has no backend that could reasonably
      benefit from this performance increase-- I would much rather write code in a vastly
      superior language to JS (which is any language) as I've known many other webdev's do.</p>
    <p>The question really to beg is why haven't I written any web-based application since
      m0o-tab? Well to simply put it-- I still consider myself a novice of the craft. Sure I can
      put together nice projects, but I know that there are better ways to write things. Genpass is
      a great example of this: I have written so much functionality into it, but the codebase is SOOOOOO
      fucked looking back at it. I could do things in a much more organized way and written it to not have such
      cancerous matching implementations, but at the time it made sense to me. Now looking at it, I rather should
      have written a better structured system, which I plan on doing sometime this year (2026).</p>
    <p>However, if the need arises to create like a blog indexing system/organization system, I'll write it. It's just
      that right now? Too focused on other things. Things that matter really-- like school, and 'work' (if you can even call
      it that, I just write software and look at software all day, which makes me happy still :P)</p>
