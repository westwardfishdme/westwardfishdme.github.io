  <h1>Welcome to the Pub</h1>
  <div>

    <p>
      Welcome to my more "unprofessional" blog.
      <br><br>
      Here in the pub, the full degenerate side of me comes out. This is where
      you'll find me yapping my ass off about whatever I feel like; however I like.
    <ul>
      <li>No censors.</li>
      <li>No filter.</li>
      <li>No comment.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're more sensitive to foul language, this probably isn't the place for you.<br>
      For the most part, we'll keep things rated like-- PG-13 to R. Actually, 21+ is probably the most
      accurate rating for this portion of my site.
    </p>
    <p>My girlfriend got this stuck in my head, she says this to me all the time lmao:</p>

  <h2>Let's play a game:</h2>
  <div>
    <p>Of course, what fun is there without a little drinking? Of course, this game is entirely optional,
      if you don't want to participate you don't have to, but if you do: kudos.</p>

    <p>Here are the rules: Every time I...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>curse? Take a shot.</li>
      <li>complain about something? Take a shot.</li>
      <li>make a raunchy statement? Take a shot.</li>
      <li>see a 'tpyo'? Take a shot, because I probably did too.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you aren't ass-blast drunk by the end of a blogpost-- you either have some serious
      drinking problems, or you're not playing the game. If you're the first-- I unironically mean this:
      please get help.
    </p>

  <h2>My made up "FAQ":</h2>
  <p>Obviously there is not a way to ask me questions other than email, and no one cares enough to email me, so
    these are questions that I had asked myself and calculated some of the answers to the questions
    I didn't want to answer from my magic 8-ball:</p>
  <div>
    <h3>What will you even talk about here?</h3>
    <p>It is likely so.</p>
    <h3>What if an employer sees this?</h3>
    <p>I don't care. I expect them to. I care more about failing a technical
      than I do about how they feel about what some fucking idiot says on the internet.</p>
    <h3>Don't you think this is a *bit* corny?</h3>
    <img src="../pics/cob.png">
    <h3>Will you talk about &lbrace;x&rbrace;?</h3>
    <p>Yes.</p>
    <h3>Are you like this IRL?</h3>
    <p>Not at all-- maybe if I get to know you after a
      couple months and I feel comfortable saying shit like this,
      then yeah.</p>
    <p>I definitely do get like this from time to time. Should get that checked out tbh.</p>
    <h3>Why does this section of the blog have more posts than the other sections?</h3>
    <p>Creativity is the result of being able to express yourself freely without the shackles of
      inhibition and limitations. Authenticity derives itself from the creative.
      I'm a very authentic person. <br><br>You can put the dots together.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Aren't you afraid that you're saying this stuff with your face and full government name publically available?
    </h3>
    <p>Concentrate and ask again.</p>
