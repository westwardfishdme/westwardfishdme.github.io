  <h1>About:</h1>
  <p>Hello-- my name is Jonathan; but most of my friends call me Finch.
    This site is my new site, most of which is porting old content from my
    old site here. Some of you who have used my <br><a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/westwardfishdme/moo-tab">[moo-tab]</a> built-in wiki layout. (btw rip to that project, I
    haven't updated it in years-- so if you're using it and still expecting updates I am so sorry.)
    <br><br>
    I suck at writing web pages, web design and UI/UX was never my expertise-- which is why most of my software is
    command line based, but at least this page is not AI generated. Although I have 'vibe-coded' (and I mean very
    limited use) <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/merci-libre/scfetch">ONE project</a> in the past, I am
    actually very against the use of AI for code generation, academic paper generation, or anything else for that
    matter. This is due to many personal philosophical, political, and ethical reasons that have surrounded the damage
    that AI and AI companies have caused in recent years.
  </p>
  <p>With that in mind, please don't critique the site in the manner of design, I don't really care all for aesthetics,
    and besides the design philosphy and style that AI follows is completely, and I mean utterly 'horseshit'.
  </p>
